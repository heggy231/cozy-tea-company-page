flex box based cozy tea company page
[live demo](https://heggy231.github.io/cozy-tea-company-page/)
## Given provided [design spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heggy231/cozy-tea-company-page/master/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg) I created responsive flex-box based website.

![design spec redline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heggy231/cozy-tea-company-page/master/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg)

Lesson: 
1. hard to get the nave bar spread out.  
At first used unordered list to create the nav items and flex-box wouldn't work.

2. transferring what redline says to actual code.
